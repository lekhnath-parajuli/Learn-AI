But the truth is that ancient civilizations already theorized and imagined objects that work by themselves. But that’s all it was, imagination. Today, thanks to technological advances, we can put these theories into practice.\n\nWe’ve been talking about artificial intelligence since 1956, growing very slowly and without much success. However, since 1990 it experienced a boom, the public began to internalize and become familiar with the term and it is growing faster than ever.\n\nAs I say, it is undeniable that Artificial Intelligence is growing at a very fast rate. As new developments are made, wonderful conferences are organized to educate the world on its multiple uses and advantages. In this post we are listing the 15 most important artificial intelligence events of the next year 2019 so you will be up to date and don’t miss them!"
